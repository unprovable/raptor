    at an unknown earlier time.

    Terminal-status guard: refuses to overwrite an already-terminal
    state (completed / failed / cancelled). Pre-fix the function
    silently flipped any status to any other status, so:
      * `fail_run` called after `complete_run` (e.g. by exception
        handlers in caller's `finally` after the lifecycle already
        completed) downgraded a successful run to failed, masking
        the actual outcome.
      * `complete_run` called after `fail_run` (cleanup loop racing
        a real failure handler) upgraded a failed run to completed
        — operator sees green, the failure is invisible.
    Logs at warning level so the racing-caller bug is investigable
    rather than hidden.

    Raises FileNotFoundError if metadata file doesn't exist (call start_run first).
