"""Disk-backed JSON cache with TTL.

A small key→JSON store with atomic-rename writes and per-entry TTL.
Designed for caching deterministic, infrequently-changing data —
e.g. HTTP feed responses, advisory records, lookup tables — where
re-fetching is expensive and a stale window of seconds-to-days is
acceptable.

Layout:
  Each key maps to a file under the supplied root. Keys may contain
  ``/`` to denote subdirectories, e.g. ``vulns/GHSA-xxx`` →
  ``<root>/vulns/GHSA-xxx.json``.

Concurrency:
  Writes use atomic rename — write to ``<path>.tmp.<pid>.<tid>``,
  then rename. Tempfile names include both pid and thread id so
  concurrent writers (cross-process or cross-thread within a
  process) never share a tempfile path. Concurrent writers are
  last-writer-wins, which is correct because cache values are
  deterministic per key. Readers see either the old version or
  the new version, never a torn write.

Failure modes (silent, by design):
  - Cache root unwritable → in-memory-only mode (every put no-ops,
    every get returns None). The run still succeeds, just slower.
  - Corrupted entries (truncated, invalid JSON, missing fields) →
    treated as miss, caller refetches.

Caller TTL semantics:
  ``get(key, ttl_seconds=N)`` returns the cached value only if the
  entry is younger than ``min(stored_ttl, N)``. So a caller can
  effectively shorten the TTL of pre-existing entries (e.g.
  ``--offline`` mode might decide that a 24h-old entry is now
  stale even though it was written with a 7d TTL).
