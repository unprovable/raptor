"""Shared source inventory for RAPTOR analysis skills.

Provides language-aware file enumeration, code item extraction (functions,
globals, macros, classes), SHA-256 checksumming, SLOC counting, and
cumulative coverage tracking.

Usage:
    from core.inventory import build_inventory, get_coverage_stats, get_items

    inventory = build_inventory("/path/to/repo", "/path/to/output")
    stats = get_coverage_stats(inventory)
