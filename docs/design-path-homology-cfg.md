# Path Homology as a Reverse-Engineering Structural Signal

Proposal to add **path homology** — a directed-graph generalization of
cyclomatic complexity — to RAPTOR as a per-function *structural* signal in
the binary reverse-engineering path. It is a metric / triage / decompiler-
confidence signal, **not** a soundness primitive: it never licenses a
suppression and never touches the sanitizer-cut chokepoint.

Status: **Phases 1–4.5 done; Phase 5 reverted; arc lands as reported-only
telemetry + two negative results.** β_2 / irreducibility failed its Phase 4
gate (vacuous on real binaries — 1 / 8,459 functions). The arc pivoted to
β_1 (Huntsman's grep result was β_1-based), but the β_1-vs-cyclomatic
head-to-head showed **β_1 does not beat plain cyclomatic complexity**
(AUC 0.693 vs 0.707) while costing far more — so the briefly-added β_1
ranking term was reverted. Under `--path-homology`, `path_betti` /
`cyclomatic` are surfaced for inspection but **nothing feeds ranking**;
default runs are unchanged. Phases 6–7 (source-level / persistence) on
hold. This is a follow-on metrics arc to
`design-aggregation-dominators-wp.md` (Project B built the CFG / `Graph`
substrate this reuses).

## 1. Summary

Cyclomatic complexity `v(G) = |E| − |V| + 1` is the first Betti number of
the **undirected** control-flow graph: it counts independent cycles and is
identically zero in every dimension above 1. **Path homology** (Grigor'yan–
Lin–Muranov–Yau; applied to control flow by Huntsman 2020) is a homology
theory for **directed** graphs whose Betti numbers `β_p` can be nonzero in
*arbitrary* dimension. For *structured* control flow (if / while / repeat)
it coincides with cyclomatic complexity (`β_1 = v(G)`, `β_{p≥2} = 0`). The
two **diverge only on unstructured control flow** — assembly jumps, gotos,
irreducible loops, control-flow flattening — where `β_2, β_3, …` become
nonzero.

(A refinement learned while building the Phase 1 core: on the bare CFG,
direction-aware `β_1` *fills the commutative square* between the two
branches of an if/else, so `β_1 ≤ cyclomatic` — it agrees with cyclomatic
on genuine loops but counts loops and higher voids rather than
branchiness. Adding the virtual exit→entry arc, McCabe's strongly-
connected convention, recovers strict `β_1 = cyclomatic` for structured
code. The implementation computes on the graph as given and reports both
numbers.)

That divergence regime is exactly the binary / disassembly / decompiler
surface. This proposal adds:

1. a pure-Python path-homology core over RAPTOR's existing `Graph`
   protocol (`core/inventory/dominators.py`);
2. per-function basic-block CFG extraction in the r2-driven RE path
   (`packages/binary_analysis/radare2_understand.py`);
3. a Betti vector per function, surfaced as (a) a triage / fuzz-priority
   term and (b) a **decompiler-confidence** tag — gated behind a corpus
   reproduction before it influences ranking.

## 2. Motivation

Two concrete RE problems RAPTOR has no signal for today:

- **Decompiler-output confidence.** Decompilers (r2 `pdc` / `pdg`, Ghidra)
  run *control-flow structuring* to recover `if`/`while`/`for`. When a
  function's CFG is **irreducible**, structuring fails and the decompiler
  emits gotos, duplicated blocks, or `while(true){…}` soup. Irreducibility
  is exactly the `β_2 > 0` case. So path homology is a direct proxy for
  "the decompiled C the LLM is about to reason over is probably mangled —
  discount it / route for human attention." `radare2_understand.py` feeds
  decompiled output to the LLM (`_llm_prioritise`, `radare2_understand.py:918`)
  with no such calibration.
- **Obfuscation / anti-analysis triage.** Control-flow flattening, opaque
  predicates, and hand-written asm all produce irreducible CFGs and thus
  high higher-dimensional homology. Cyclomatic complexity *cannot* see this
  (directionless, dimension-1 only). Path homology is purpose-built for it,
  and separates "big but simple" (200-block linear parser, `β_2 = 0`) from
  "small but gnarly" (30-block jump-interleaved function, `β_2 > 0`) — the
  latter being where bugs and obfuscation hide.

Huntsman's evaluation on GNU grep binaries (NIST SARD, vulnerable vs.
benign) found the injected-vulnerability function `dfamust` was a
structural outlier in the `(cyclomatic, β_1)` plane — suggestive that
homological features track "structurally relevant" control flow that the
scalar metric misses.

Mathematical foundations the paper builds on:

- A. Grigor'yan, Y. Lin, Yu. Muranov, S.-T. Yau. *Homologies of path
  complexes and digraphs.* arXiv:1207.2834 (2012); and related
  *Homotopy theory for digraphs*, *Path homology theory of multigraphs
  and quivers* (2014–2018) — the construction of path homology on
  directed graphs.
- S. Chowdhury, F. Mémoli. *Persistent path homology of directed
  networks.* SODA 2018 — the persistence variant (future work, §8).
- T. J. McCabe. *A complexity measure.* IEEE TSE SE-2 (1976) — cyclomatic

### Path homology in one screen

Let `D = (V, E)` be a loopless digraph. An **allowed `p`-path** is a
sequence of vertices `(v_0, …, v_p)` with `(v_{j-1}, v_j) ∈ E` for every
step (a real walk along edges). The non-regular boundary operator

```
∂(v_0, …, v_p) = Σ_j (−1)^j (v_0, …, v̂_j, …, v_p)
```

deletes each interior vertex in turn. A walk stays a walk under most
deletions, but deleting an interior vertex can produce a sequence that is
*not* a walk; the **path complex** `Ω_p` is the subspace of allowed paths
whose boundary is *also* allowed (`∂Ω_p ⊆ Ω_{p-1}`). The homology of
`(Ω_•, ∂)` is the path homology of `D`; its Betti numbers are `β_p`.

For control flow:

- `β_0` = weakly-connected components (1 for a normal function CFG).
- `β_1` = directed independent cycles. Agrees with cyclomatic complexity
  on genuine loops; *direction-aware*, so on branch/merge structure it is
  strictly smaller (`β_1 ≤ cyclomatic`) — the commutative square between
  two branches is filled. Verified in Phase 1 (`test_path_homology.py`).
- `β_2, β_3, …` = higher-dimensional "voids," nonzero only for
  unstructured / irreducible control flow. Huntsman's Figs 2–3 exhibit
  minimal digraphs with `β_2 = 1` and `β_3 = 1` that are realizable as
  assembly-level CFGs.

## 4. Where it fits in RAPTOR (and where it does not)

Confirmed by codebase survey — RAPTOR has **no** complexity metric of any
kind today (no cyclomatic, no Betti, no block/edge counts in non-test
code), but it *does* have the directed-graph substrate a homology
computation consumes.

### Fits

- **`core/inventory/dominators.py`** — the `Graph` protocol (`:57`,
  `entry` / `nodes()` / `successors()`) is the universal directed-graph
  interface; a `betti(graph, max_dim)` function is a drop-in sibling of
  `build_dom_tree` (`:263`).
- **`packages/binary_analysis/radare2_understand.py`** — the primary
  home. It already drives r2 per function (`_tag_dangerous_callers`,
  `:638`) and decompiles top functions (`_decompile_priorities`, `:807`).
  It builds only a *function-granularity call graph* today; r2's
  `afbj` / `agfj @ <addr>` returns the per-function **basic-block CFG**
  as JSON, one call away. The per-function scoring hook already exists:
  `_heuristic_prioritise._score(fn)` (`:878`) and the `fuzz_priorities`
  records (`:905`); a Betti term / field slots straight in.
- **Annotation sinks** for the computed score: `FunctionInfo` (`:92`),
  the per-function triage enrichment in
  `core/orchestration/reachability_enrichment.py` (`:204`), the inventory
  metadata in `core/inventory/binary_oracle_edges.py` (`:572`), and the
  persistent `/annotate` store (`core/annotations/storage.py`).

### Does **not** fit (scope guard)

- **Source-level Python CFGs** (`core/inventory/cfg_builder.py`).
  Structured control flow ⇒ `β_{≥2} = 0` ⇒ it merely reproduces a
  cyclomatic number on code that is essentially never irreducible. Low
  value; excluded from the arc. (C/C++ source is *in* scope — see
  Phase 6 — because `cfg_builder_cpp.py` models `goto` / `switch`
  fallthrough / `do/while`, the constructs that actually produce
  irreducible source-level control flow.)
- **The sanitizer-cut chokepoint** (`core/inventory/sanitizer_cut.py`).
  That needs *sound reachability* (vertex cut). Path homology is a fuzzy
  metric and must never gate a suppression. Hard boundary.
- **Crash analysis** (`crash_agent.py`) consumes only a linear
  disassembly window, no CFG — nothing to score.

## 5. Design

- **`core/inventory/path_homology.py`** — pure Python, no SciPy / NumPy /
  NetworkX (honors the runtime-dep rule in CLAUDE.md). Computes `β_0 … β_k`
  over `GF(2)` by Gaussian elimination on the sparse boundary matrices.
  `k` capped (default 3). Input is anything satisfying the `Graph`
  protocol; output a small `BettiVector` dataclass. Cost is bounded for
  per-function CFGs (tens of blocks, out-degree ≈ 2); a node/path budget
  with a `homology_complete: bool` flag guards pathological functions, the
  same shape as the WP-extraction cap in Project C.
- **r2 extraction** — add one `afbj @ <addr>` (basic blocks + edges) per
  prioritized function inside the existing per-function loop; adapt the
  JSON to a tiny `Graph` adapter. Cached per build-id alongside the
  existing r2 caching, since r2 invocations are the slow part.
- **Surfacing** — Betti vector becomes a field on `FunctionInfo`,
  `fuzz_priorities`, and the binary `context-map.json`; plus a derived
  boolean `decompiler_low_confidence = (β_2 > 0)` tag consumed by the LLM
  decompiler prompt as a discount hint. **Behind a flag until Phase 4
  clears.**

## 6. Phases

Sequential. Each ships independently; the scoring influence (Phase 5) is
gated on the validation in Phase 4.

| Phase | Scope | Ships | Status |
|------:|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Homology core.** `core/inventory/path_homology.py`: `betti(graph, max_dim)` over `GF(2)`, dims 0–3, dep-free; `BettiVector` dataclass + per-dim path budget with `complete` flag; `cyclomatic_number` companion. | Module + 27 unit tests: the closed-form layered-digraph oracle `K_{n…}` (`β_2 = 1`, `β_3 = 1`, `β_2 = 2`), `β_0` = components, directed-cycle `β_1`, structured-CFG triviality (`β_{≥2} = 0`), the if/else `β_1 < cyclomatic` divergence, and budget truncation. No integration. | **done** |
| 2 | **Binary CFG extraction.** Per-function basic-block CFG via r2 `afbj` in `radare2_understand.py`; `Graph` adapter; per-build-id cache. | `packages/binary_analysis/function_cfg.py` (`BasicBlockCFG` adapter + `parse_afbj` + build-id cache, all r2-free/testable); `FunctionInfo.basic_block_cfg` populated under opt-in `analyse(extract_cfgs=True)` (off by default → no cost/behaviour change); 16 unit tests. No scoring change. | **done** |
| 3 | **Compute + surface (reported only).** Betti vector per function; attach to `FunctionInfo`, `fuzz_priorities`, `binary-context-map.json`; derive `decompiler_low_confidence` (β_2 > 0). Behind `--path-homology` (off by default), plumbed `analyse → analyse_binary_context → orchestrator.execute → raptor_fuzzing` CLI. | `compute_path_homology` + `homology_report` (module-level, r2-free/testable); `FunctionInfo` fields + `to_dict`/fuzz-priority surfacing; β_2>0 context note; 8 unit tests. No ranking effect (does not feed `_score`). | **done** |
| 4 | **Validation gate (β_2).** Does `β_2⁺` separate vulnerable/benign, or predict decompiler-structuring failure (`goto` in `pdc`)? | `core/inventory/path_homology_precision.py` + `libexec/raptor-path-homology-precision` (cross-tab, risk ratio, rule-of-three, non-vacuousness guard). **8,459 functions / 6 binaries → NO-GO** (β_2 vacuous; see "Phase 4 result"). | **done — NO-GO (β_2)** |
| 4.5 | **β_1 pivot validation.** Is **β_1** non-vacuous, and — the decisive test — does it separate attack-surface functions *better than the cyclomatic baseline it must beat to justify the homology machinery*? | `beta1_report` / `compare_to_cyclomatic` (threshold-free AUC) added. β_1 is dense (54% non-zero) and tracks attack surface, **but does NOT beat cyclomatic**: AUC β_1 0.693 vs cyclomatic 0.707 (Δ −0.014); gap AUC 0.700. All collinear (size). See "Phase 4.5 result". | **done — NO improvement over cyclomatic** |
| 5 | ~~Wire β_1 into triage.~~ | **Reverted.** The β_1 term was added then removed once the head-to-head showed β_1 ≤ cyclomatic (cheaper, marginally better). Nothing feeds ranking; path homology stays reported-only. | **reverted** |
| 6 | **Source-level C/C++ signal.** Homology over `cfg_builder_cpp.py`'s goto/switch-aware CFG. | — | **on hold** — source β_2 faces the same vacuity; a β_1 source signal is the candidate if pursued |
| 7 | **Persistent path homology.** Persistent path homology (Chowdhury–Mémoli) over the nesting hierarchy. | — | **on hold** |

**Phases 1–4.5 done; Phase 5 reverted.** Phases 1–3 shipped the
reported-only machinery. **Phase 4 returned NO-GO for β_2** (vacuous on
real binaries). **Phase 4.5 pivoted to β_1** and ran the decisive
head-to-head: **β_1 does not beat cyclomatic complexity** (AUC 0.693 vs
0.707), so the briefly-added Phase 5 ranking term was **reverted**. The
arc lands as reported-only telemetry plus two clean negative results; the
evidence gate did its job twice. Phases 6–7 on hold. See the result
sections below.

## Phase 4 result — NO-GO (β_2 signal vacuous on real binaries)

Ran `path_homology_precision` over **8,459 functions** from six macOS
system binaries (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `bash`, `perl`, `vim`), with
radare2 6.1.6.

- **Non-vacuousness fails.** Exactly **1 / 8,459** functions had
  `β_2 > 0` (a single `vim` function, β = (1, 246, 1)). Modern
  compiler output is overwhelmingly *reducible*, so the irreducibility
  signal essentially never fires. The harness's non-vacuousness guard
  returns NO-GO: "signal absent — cannot validate." Claim (a)
  (vuln separation) is unassessable at this base rate.
- **The decompiler-confidence proxy is invalidated independently.**
  Among 313 decompiled functions, **68% of *reducible* (β_2 = 0)
  functions already contain `goto`** in r2's `pdc` output (e.g.
  `/bin/ls` `main`: β = (1, 22, 0), yet 27 gotos). r2's structurer emits
  gotos liberally regardless of irreducibility, so `β_2 > 0` carries no
  predictive signal over the decompiler's baseline. Claim (b) fails on
  its own terms.

**Decision.** The binary β_2 / `decompiler_low_confidence` signal does
**not** earn a place in prioritisation. Phase 5 is cancelled. Phases 1–3
remain as *reported-only* telemetry (harmless, off by default; the
`path_betti` / `cyclomatic` fields they surface are still informative
when an operator asks for them) — but nothing feeds `_score()`.

**Constructive pivot — taken (Phase 4.5).** Huntsman's actual
vulnerability result (the grep `dfamust` outlier, Fig 8–9) was a
**β_1 / cyclomatic** anomaly in *dimension 1* — not β_2. So we pivoted to
β_1 rather than abandoning the arc (see next).

## Phase 4.5 result — GO (β_1)

Same corpus (8,457 functions with β_1 computed), β_1 instead of β_2.
Labels are an *attack-surface proxy* — the pipeline's own
dangerous-sink reachability (`calls_dangerous` /
`transitively_reaches_dangerous`), not CVE ground truth.

- **Non-vacuous** (clears β_2's failure mode): **54%** of functions have
  `β_1 > 0`; **67.5%** have a non-zero `cyclomatic − β_1` gap — so the
  direction-aware refinement genuinely occurs (β_1 is not a cyclomatic
  clone).
- **Separation**: functions reaching a dangerous sink have **mean β_1
  15.75 vs 3.94** for the rest; "high β_1" (corpus top quartile) is
  over-represented among sink-reachers with **risk ratio 2.27**
  (P=0.55 vs 0.24).

β_1 clears the *non-vacuity* bar β_2 failed (dense; tracks attack
surface), so initially this read as a GO. **But the decisive test is
whether β_1 beats the baseline it would replace — cyclomatic complexity —
not whether it beats chance.** Adding that head-to-head changed the
verdict.

**Head-to-head (threshold-free AUC, label = reaches-dangerous proxy,
8,457 functions):**

| metric | AUC |
|---|---|
| cyclomatic complexity | **0.707** |
| β_1 | 0.693 |
| gap (cyclomatic − β_1) | 0.700 |

β_1 is **0.014 *worse*** than plain cyclomatic, and the gap (β_1's
distinctive direction-aware contribution) carries no independent signal —
all three are collinear, jointly measuring function size/complexity.
**Conclusion: β_1 does not improve on cyclomatic for this task**, and it
is far more expensive (r2 `afbj` + GF(2) elimination vs `|E|−|V|+c`).

**Honest caveats on even this comparison.** The label is a size-confounded
attack-surface proxy, not CVE ground truth; an AUC of ~0.70 for *all*
three is "complexity correlates with attack surface," already captured by
the existing dangerous-sink scoring. A labelled, size-stratified NIST
SARD run could in principle show β_1 separating *within* size strata where
cyclomatic cannot — but on the evidence in hand, β_1 loses, so nothing is
wired.

## Phase 5 — reverted

A bounded β_1 term (`min(β_1, 8)`) was briefly added to
`_heuristic_prioritise._score`, then **removed** once the head-to-head
above showed β_1 ≤ cyclomatic. Wiring the more expensive, no-better
metric into ranking would have been exactly the unvalidated-signal
mistake the Phase 4 gate exists to prevent. Path homology therefore stays
**reported-only**: under `--path-homology`, `path_betti` and `cyclomatic`
are surfaced in `binary-context-map.json` for inspection, but **nothing
feeds prioritisation**. Default runs are unchanged.

Phases 6–7 remain on hold — and the bar for unblocking them is now
higher: a *source-level* β_1 would have to beat source cyclomatic, which
the binary result makes unlikely without new evidence.

## Follow-up (open) — size-controlled β_1 validation on labelled ground truth

Phase 4.5's GO rests on (1) an *attack-surface proxy* label and (2) a
β_1 ↔ size confound. Before β_1 earns more than its current bounded,
gated weight — and before Phases 6–7 are worth revisiting — it must show
signal **beyond size, on real vulnerability labels**.

- **Corpus.** NIST SARD (Juliet C/C++, or the grep variants Huntsman
  used) — vulnerable/fixed function pairs with ground-truth labels.
  Building it requires compilation (operator-run; *not* CI — honours the
  no-long-local-builds rule).
- **Method.** Reuse `records_from_binary` (β_1, cyclomatic, `gap =
  cyclomatic − β_1` are already captured) with a manifest carrying
  `vulnerable_functions` per SARD metadata. Then test β_1 **stratified
  by size**: within cyclomatic-complexity buckets, does β_1 (or the gap)
  still separate vulnerable from benign? Equivalently, an odds ratio for
  β_1 with cyclomatic as a covariate. The point is to dissolve the
  "bigger functions reach more sinks" confound.
- **Decision rule.** The corpus head-to-head already shows β_1 ≤ cyclomatic
  *overall*; the only remaining hope is that β_1 separates *within* size
  strata where cyclomatic cannot. If it does → reconsider wiring β_1 (and
  revisit Phases 6–7). If it doesn't → the arc closes: path homology
  stays reported-only and cyclomatic is the metric of record.
- **Command.** `libexec/raptor-path-homology-precision <sard-manifest.json>`
  (manifest: `{"binaries":[{"path":..,"vulnerable_functions":[..]}]}`).

## 7. Validation / evidence gate (Phase 4 detail)

RAPTOR's culture is corpus-earned precision (cf. the binary-oracle's
1952/1952 + rule-of-three bound). Path-homology-as-signal had *none* of
that — Huntsman's vuln result is essentially one outlier on one utility.
So Phase 5 was gated on Phase 4 demonstrating, on a real corpus, at
least one of:

1. **Vulnerability separation** — functions with `β_2 > 0` are
   over-represented among known-vulnerable functions vs. a benign base
   rate (effect size + simple interval, not just a point estimate).
2. **Decompiler-confidence validity** — `β_2 > 0` predicts decompiler-
   structuring failure (goto/duplication in `pdc`/`pdg`) better than
   cyclomatic complexity or block count alone.

**Outcome: neither held** (see "Phase 4 result" above). Per the
pre-committed rule, the arc stops at Phase 3 — Betti numbers remain a
*reported* curiosity, never a ranking input — and the negative result is
recorded. Re-run the harness anytime on a labelled corpus with
`libexec/raptor-path-homology-precision <manifest.json>` (manifest:
`{"binaries":[{"path":..,"vulnerable_functions":[..]}]}`).

## 8. Risks and open questions

- **Empirical-only theory.** The "structurally relevant" claim is
  suggestive, not proven (the paper itself says "not yet a mathematical
  proof"). Mitigation: Phase 4 gate; reported-only until then.
- **Cost on pathological functions.** Allowed-path enumeration can grow;
  capped dimension + node/path budget + `homology_complete` flag bound it.
  Open: the right default budget for real binaries (set empirically in
  Phase 2).
- **Reducibility of compiled code.** Most compiler output is reducible, so
  `β_2 > 0` may be *rare* — which is fine if rarity = signal, but Phase 4
  must check it isn't simply *absent* on the corpus (the non-vacuousness
  check, mirroring the binary-oracle held-out "live function" guard).
- **`β_1` vs. McCabe direction mismatch.** Path-homology `β_1` is
  direction-aware, so it can disagree with classic cyclomatic complexity
  even in dimension 1. Decide whether to report both (recommended) so the
  divergence is visible rather than silently substituting one for the
  other.
- **r2 dependency surface.** Extraction runs under the existing r2
  sandboxing (`core.sandbox.run`); no new trust surface, but adds r2
  calls to the per-function loop — hence the per-build-id cache.

## 9. Out of scope (explicit)

- Any use of homology to gate suppression / soundness decisions.
- Source-level **Python** homology (structured ⇒ trivial).
- Persistent path homology beyond the Phase 7 prototype (full
  birth/death persistence-diagram tooling is a later arc if the
  prototype proves out).
- Arc-crossing / drawing-complexity analysis (NP-hard; Huntsman §3 notes
  this and does not pursue it — neither do we).
