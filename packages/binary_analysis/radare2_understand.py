"""Binary-level adversarial context mapping using radare2.

The source-level `/understand` does not work on stripped binaries because
it has no source code to read. This module is the binary equivalent: it
drives radare2 via r2pipe, extracts structural information useful to
RAPTOR workflows, optionally decompiles high-value functions through
r2ghidra, and asks the LLM to identify entry points, trust boundaries,
and dangerous sinks based on the decompiled output.

Output is a BinaryContextMap with the same shape as the source-level
context-map.json so downstream consumers can treat source and binary
analysis uniformly.

Capability requirements:
  - radare2 in PATH (binary)
  - r2pipe python module (pip install r2pipe)
  - r2ghidra plugin for high-quality decompilation (recommended).
    Falls back to built-in pdc which is rougher but always present.

        reach a sink within that depth.

        Why: _tag_dangerous_callers above only tags DIRECT callers. The
        real-world CVE pattern is a parser routine that builds a struct,
        passes it through 2-3 internal helpers, and only THEN reaches
        strcpy / memcpy / etc. Those intermediate parsers are exactly
        what the fuzzer should hammer — but they don't directly call
        any dangerous import so calls_dangerous wouldn't flag them.

        Approach: single `aflcj` call gets the whole call graph as JSON
        (one r2 cmd, not 100s of per-function axt calls). BFS backwards
        from each sink name through the inverted adjacency list. The
        FunctionInfo records gain transitively_reaches_dangerous (list
        of sink names) and transitive_distance (min hops to any sink).

        Per-function transitive flag composes additively with
        calls_dangerous: a function that DIRECTLY calls strcpy AND
        transitively reaches gets will surface in both lists, with
